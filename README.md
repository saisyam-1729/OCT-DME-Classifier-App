# 👁️ OCT DME Classifier

An interactive web application to **detect Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)** from OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) images of the eye using a deep learning model. Designed for clinical relevance and ease of use.

---

## 🚀 Project Motivation

Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) is one of the leading causes of vision loss among diabetic patients. Early diagnosis and treatment can **prevent permanent vision damage**. However, manual screening of OCT scans can be time-consuming and subject to human error.

This app aims to:

- **Automate** the classification of OCT reports into categories: CME, DRT, SRD, NOR.
- **Engage users** (e.g., ophthalmologists or technicians) by allowing feedback on predictions.
- **Store user and prediction data** for continual system improvement.

---

## 🧠 How it Works

This application is powered by a **YOLOv11-based image classification model** fine-tuned on multiple DME categories. It's built using **Streamlit** for the frontend and **Python** for backend processing and logging.

---

### 3️⃣ Wait for Classification  
The system will classify **left** and **right** eye images into appropriate DME categories.


---

### 4️⃣ Submit Feedback  
You can agree or disagree with the system's predictions for each eye.

## 📂 Logs and Learning

- All interactions (user name, prediction result, feedback) are **logged** securely.
- These logs can be used for future **model improvement**, retraining, and performance audits.
